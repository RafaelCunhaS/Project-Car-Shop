## Car Shop

Back-end project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

In this project I used the principles of __Object Oriented Proggraming__(OOP) with __TypeScript__ to build a _CRUD API_ to manage a car shop. The dabase used on the project was the __MongoDB__ and to simplify the data handling from it I used the __Mongoose__ __Object Data Modeling__(ODM).
